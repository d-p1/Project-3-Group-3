# Road trip

John is embarking on a family road trip, with a mission to reduce his carbon footprint by opting for an electric car. However, a minor challenge arises: the search for available charging stations. 

For this project, we will design a leaflet map that displays the locations of charging stations along John's route from his initial starting point to his ultimate destination.

Our visualization will include a Python Flask-powered API, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and SQL
